#Arbitrary Precision and Arbitrary n-Grams
##By Alec Story and Thomas Levine
`./ngram.py` to see the different command-line flags for ngram.py

An example usage is:

./ngram.py --make-sentences

which will make sentences from the Shakespeare corpus.  We support that corpus
and the War and Peace corpus.  If you run it on other corpora, you will probably
get weird results.
